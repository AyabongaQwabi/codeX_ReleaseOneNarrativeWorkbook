## Javascript on the command line

So far all the Javascript you wrote ran in a web browser. That don't need to be the case, one can run Javascript on the command line and use it to program much more than buttons, fields and elements in the browser. A world of programming Web Servers, Robots and Databases to name but a few options awaits.

### Try these fun modules:

Here are two modules that I would like you to give a try.

* https://www.npmjs.com/package/text-animation
* https://www.npmjs.com/package/figlet
 
Be sure to create a ```NarrativeWorkbook``` folder in your projects folder.
* in that create a ```modules101``` folder
* then type ```npm init``` - follow along, you will need to press enter a few times, you can change the defaults if you like
* in the ```modules101``` folder there should be package.json file - see what it looks like.
* node install the figlet module using this command: ```npm install --save figlet```
* check how the package file changed
* now write a program using the figlet module to display 'codeX is cool!'
* Now use the text-animation module and animate 'codeX is cool'. Pro-tip: you'll need to install it first
